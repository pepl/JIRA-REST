{{$NEXT}}

0.009     2014-09-09 20:32:15 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Fix the set_search_iterator/next_issue pair of methods.

  [Changes]

  - The iterators now use JIRA's own default (which is 50) when the
    'maxResults' argument isn't set. Previously our default was set to 256.

0.008     2014-09-06 19:14:06 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - Show every detail in JIRA error messages. Some of which weren't being
    shown before. (Thanks to Michael Kr√∂ll for the tip.)

0.006     2014-08-16 20:50:07 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - Suppress script line numbers from error messages.

  - Released on #cpanday.

0.005     2014-08-07 20:25:14 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - New utility methods 'set_search_iterator' and 'next_issue' make it
    easier to iterate through large sets of issues without having to deal
    with "pagination".

  - Error messages are not presented in a consistent format. JIRA errors are
    parsed and presented in a legible way.

0.004     2013-12-14 14:54:06 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - [RT-91368] Some resource responses contain no content but specify
    a Content-Type. Those were being considered errors. Now they
    simply return undef.

  - When a resource response contains a content but doesn't specify a
    Content-Type it's an error. Previously it was returning undef.
