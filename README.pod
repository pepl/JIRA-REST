JIRA::REST - Thin wrapper around JIRA's REST API

CAUTION - THIS IS STILL BETA CODE

L<JIRA|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira> is a proprietary bug
tracking system from
L<Atlassian|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/>.

This module is a thin wrapper around L<JIRA's REST
API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/>, which is
superseding it's old L<SOAP
API|http://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/rpc-jira-plugin/latest/com/atlassian/jira/rpc/soap/JiraSoapService.html>,
for which there is another Perl module called
L<JIRA::Client|http://search.cpan.org/dist/JIRA-Client/>.
